      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At the heart of our journey is a shared passion—to make buying high-performance cars an experience as smooth and exhilarating 
        as the drive itself. We aim to bring luxury and performance together by offering sports cars that don’t just look stunning, but 
        feel right. Precision, power, and individuality drive everything we do.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We see a future where car enthusiasts don’t just buy a car—they create their dream machine. Our goal is to become the go-to place 
        for those looking for that perfect mix of elegance and engineering. Whether you're after raw performance, refined design, or both, 
        we’re here to bring your vision to life.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>What started as a university project quickly turned into something more. We’re four students with a shared love for fast engines, 
        sleek designs, and clean code. In 2020, we founded this platform not just to meet a requirement—but to create something real. With 
        every specification, color option, and customization, we aim to deliver an experience that’s personal, exciting, and world-class.</p>
